This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing it with a `keyExtractor` function that doesn't return a unique key for each item.  This is essential because React Native uses these keys to efficiently update the list. If the keys are not unique, React Native might reuse existing components incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior such as incorrect data display or visual glitches. 

```javascript
//Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={[{id:1, name:'Item 1'}, {id:1, name:'Item 2'}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Duplicate IDs!
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```
